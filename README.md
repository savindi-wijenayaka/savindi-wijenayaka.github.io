Welcome to my little corner of the internet 👩🏽‍💻✨

I'm driven by the excitement of turning ideas into tools that are useful, meaningful, and make a real difference in the world. My work spans deep learning, production-grade cloud-native development, and hands-on research, with a focus on computer vision and computational analysis.

Whether you're here to explore my work, collaborate on something exciting, or just say hi — I'm glad you stopped by.
